# Project Low Key: Unified Apple App Ecosystem Architecture

## Overview
This document details the architecture for building modular, secure, and cross-platform iOS/macOS applications that integrate with Primal Genesis Engine, Athena, and LilithOS. The design leverages Swift Packages, MVVM/Clean Architecture, and a plug-in system for maximum modularity and security.

---

## Module Map

- **GenesisCore**: Business logic, models, session management
- **GenesisNetworking**: REST, WebSocket, TLS/cert pinning, OAuth2/JWT
- **GenesisCrypto**: Encrypted communication, CryptoKit utilities
- **GenesisPlugin**: Plug-in protocol for engine integration
- **UI Layer**: SwiftUI (shared), AppKit/UIKit (platform-specific)
- **CI/CD**: Fastlane, GitHub Actions, Xcode Cloud

---

## Integration Flow

1. **App Launch**
   - Loads shared Swift Packages
   - Initializes authentication and session
2. **Authentication**
   - Uses Keychain and biometrics for secure token storage
   - Supports OAuth2/JWT or custom tokens
3. **Networking**
   - REST and WebSocket clients with TLS/cert pinning
   - Real-time sync with Primal Genesis Engine
4. **Plug-in System**
   - Dynamic module registration for Genesis/Athena/LilithOS
   - Secure background sync and protocol negotiation
5. **UI**
   - SwiftUI for unified experience
   - Platform-specific enhancements via AppKit/UIKit

---

## Security Model
- All tokens and secrets stored in Keychain
- Biometric unlock for sensitive actions
- TLS with certificate pinning for all network traffic
- End-to-end encryption for engine communication
- Modular plug-in isolation and capability negotiation

## Extensibility
- New engines or protocols can be added via GenesisPlugin
- Business logic and networking are fully modular
- Security and compliance are enforced at every layer
