# INTEGRATION GUIDE: Athena, LilithOS, Primal Genesis Engine

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate Project Low Key with the Athena AI layer, LilithOS interface, and Primal Genesis Engine. It covers plugin SDK usage, secure network sync, and cryptographic best practices.

---

## 1. Plugin SDK Layer
- Implement plugins in `Modules/Core/Plugins/` conforming to the `GenesisPlugin` protocol.
- Register plugins at app launch for dynamic capability negotiation.
- Example:
```swift
import GenesisPlugin

class MyPlugin: GenesisPlugin {
    func register(with engine: GenesisEngine) { /* ... */ }
    func handle(event: GenesisEvent) { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

## 2. Secure Network Sync
- Use `Modules/Networking/` for REST and WebSocket communication.
- Enforce TLS/certificate pinning and OAuth2/JWT for all API calls.
- Use `Modules/Core/Security/` for Keychain and Secure Enclave operations.

---

## 3. Athena & LilithOS Integration
- Athena: Register agent with omnipresent AI layer via plugin protocol.
- LilithOS: Use modular UI and encrypted comms for secure, elegant interface.
- Primal Genesis Engine: Sync state and events using plugin and networking layers.

---

## 4. Security Best Practices
- Store all secrets in Keychain.
- Use biometric authentication for sensitive actions.
- All network traffic must use TLS with certificate pinning.
- Plugins are sandboxed and negotiate capabilities at runtime.

---

## 5. Extending Integration
- Add new plugins for additional engines or protocols.
- Use Combine and async/await for real-time updates.
- See `MODULE_GUIDE.md` for module extension details.
