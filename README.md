  authority: 'primary',
  quantum: true,
  divine: true
});

// Initialize User Override
const override = new UserOverride({
  authority: 'ultimate',
  instant: true,
  emergency: true
});

// Start autonomous operation
await engine.startAutonomousMode();

// User override example
await override.instantTakeover('vehicle', 'engine', {
