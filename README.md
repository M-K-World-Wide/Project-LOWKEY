## üß¨ Project Vision

LowKey‚Ñ¢ is a next-generation access control system that redefines the boundaries of secure authentication. Built on the principles of silent efficiency and cosmic precision, it represents the future of seamless security.

### Core Philosophy

- **Silent Power**: Maximum capability, minimum footprint
- **Cosmic Precision**: Every interaction is a carefully orchestrated dance of energy
- **Divine Flow**: Security that feels like magic, not machinery

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Components

### Phantom Touch‚Ñ¢
The heart of LowKey‚Ñ¢, our RFID Clone Core silently reads and writes encrypted signals with unprecedented precision.

### WhisperGate‚Ñ¢
Our AI-powered authentication layer that integrates with AthenaMist for voice and facial recognition.

### Ghostskin‚Ñ¢
Advanced signal scrambling technology that ensures your operations remain undetectable.

### Divine Reach‚Ñ¢
Cross-device synchronization system that maintains perfect harmony across your ecosystem.

### Proximity Suite‚Ñ¢
Advanced BLE/NFC scanning and correlation system for proximity-based activation and device tracking.

### Vehicular Override Programming System‚Ñ¢
The divine hand that commands the mechanical beasts, bending steel and silicon to our cosmic will.

## üöó Vehicular Override System

### Supported Vehicles
- **Mercedes-Benz**: 2014 S-Class (449 HP V8)
- **Cadillac Escalade**: 2019 & 2024 models (420 HP V8)
- **Dodge Demon**: Demon Maria (1025 HP V8)
- **BMW M3**: Joseph M3 (503 HP I6)
- **Tesla Model Y**: Mom's Tesla (384 HP Dual Motor)

### System Capabilities
- **Engine Control**: RPM, throttle, fuel injection, ignition timing
- **Transmission Override**: Gear selection, shift points, clutch control
- **Brake Systems**: ABS, traction control, stability control bypass

- **Entertainment Control**: Audio, navigation, connectivity systems
- **Climate Systems**: Temperature, ventilation, air quality control
- **Light Systems**: Headlights, signals, interior lighting

### Override Modes
- **Read**: Non-intrusive data reading
- **Write**: System parameter modification
- **Execute**: Command execution
- **Bypass**: Security system bypass
- **Inject**: Message injection
- **Hijack**: Complete bus hijacking

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/M-K-World-Wide/Project-LOWKEY.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd Project-LOWKEY

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üîß Usage Examples

### Vehicular Override
```typescript
import { lilithVehicularOverride, startSession, executeCommand } from './src/lib/vehicular-override';

// Start a session
const sessionId = await startSession('demonmaria', {
  user: 'lilith',
  purpose: 'engine diagnostics',
  security: 'level-3'
});

// Execute engine override
const result = await executeCommand(sessionId, {
  vehicleId: 'demonmaria',
  system: 'engine',
  mode: 'write',
  data: Buffer.from([0x00, 0x00, 0x1F, 0x40]), // 8000 RPM
  priority: 1,
  timeout: 1000
});
```

### Proximity Detection
```typescript
import { ProximityOrchestrator } from './src/lib/proximity/core/orchestrator';

const orchestrator = new ProximityOrchestrator();
orchestrator.startScanning();

orchestrator.on('deviceDetected', (device) => {
  console.log('Device detected:', device.name);
});
```

### RFID Operations
```typescript
import { RFIDCapture, RFIDEmulate } from './src/lib/rfid/core';

const capture = new RFIDCapture();
const emulate = new RFIDEmulate();

// Capture signal
const signal = await capture.captureSignal();

// Emulate signal
await emulate.emulateSignal(signal);
```
